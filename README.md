# Blogging

Throughout the course of Web Development Immersive, you'll be required to set up a personal technical blog, blog regularly and share some blog posts with your fellow classmates. 

But don't worry! It's going to be fun. We promise.

## Why Blog?

There are a number of very important reasons for maintaining your blog. Having a personal technical blog demonstrates that you:

* Know Your Craft

* Understand and are passionate about your industry

* Can communicate through writing

And perhaps you can even build an audience - suggesting you’re pretty darn likeable!

All of these are important down the line (don't worry about it now!) when you are engaging in the job search. 

Lastly, and very importantly, by blogging, you are giving back to the development community of which you are now a part. How many times over the past few weeks have you Googled something like "iterate over nested hash ruby" and stumbled upon someone's technical blog? Even if you haven't had that experience yet, we guarantee that over the course of the next three months, you'll follow along with some generous developers blog post to implement something like [web scraping with Ruby](https://medium.com/@LindaHaviv/the-beginner-s-guide-scraping-in-ruby-cheat-sheet-c4f9c26d1b8c#.kkwe918o4), [setting up the Devise gem in a Rails application](https://medium.com/@sherriously/switching-from-standard-bcrypt-rails-authentication-to-devise-1fd0e910bdda#.fj8ckgksq) or even [making your own gem](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/lets-make-a-gem/)

As a beginning developer, you'll find yourself taking advantage of the many wonderful blogs out there. That's one of the great things about the tech community--it's full of people who want to learn, and who want to help others learn. 

Your blog is your opportunity to give back to the tech community. 

**Don't assume that, because you are a beginner, you have nothing to contribute.** Your perspective as a beginner is immensely valuable, especially to other beginners. 

Below, we'll discuss the benefits of blogging and how you can get started. 

## Benefits of Blogging

Blogging has many benefits for job seekers and non-seekers alike.

For starters, as a new developer, blogging allows you to reflect on what you have learned. (Aka personal development.)

Blogging allows you to cement new concepts and technologies, and provides a platform in which you can go deeper in exploring those concepts. 

Learning to code takes lots of practice and lots of repetition. Once you complete one new challenge, you'll have to re-enact what you learned again and again, and even build on it. We've seen students write simple how-to blog posts and revisit their own posts again and again when faced with similar challenges. 

Blogging also sets you apart from others in the job search. When an employer sees that you have a blog, it shows you’re unique, passionate, and productive on your own time. (As in, you’re not just binge watching the newest Netflix series.) And guess what? Hiring managers want to hire people who are passionate and driven.

Even more, blogging shows a lot more than a resume does. On a resume, you simply recall your experience, accomplishments, and what skills you have. With a blog you show what you can do. It ultimately provides more information on you and your personality than a resume alone.

Aside from standing out to employers, maintaining a blog keeps you sharp. It gives you the opportunity to put your skills to use. Skills like developing and designing your website to writing content. 

Blogging also gives you the opportunity to engage with other bloggers, and vice versa. It is a great way to engage with others and build relationships with people in your industry.

Blogging is an investment in yourself. It's a space in which you can showcase what you've learned, strengthen and explore what you're learning and contribute to the larger tech community. 

And above all, it's fun! **Don't think that every blog post you write must be ground breaking.** Your blog is your space to explore what you're learning, and keep in mind that there are a lot of beginners out there that will benefit from you sharing what you're learning at every stage of your development as a developer. 

Read on for some tips on getting started!

## Getting Started

We recommend setting up your blog on an easy-to-use platform like [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [Tumbler](https://www.tumblr.com/). Setting up your blog and posting new content should be easy––reserve your effort for writing blog posts and learning to code. However, if you want a bit of an extra challenge, you can try blogging with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). Or, if you're willing to pay a monthly fee, we recommend using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). 

Don't hesitate to write your first blog post. Keep it simple. Pick a small topic that you're interested in exploring more, or a concept/technique/technology that you recently learned about that you'd like to cement for yourself. Something like [Nested Arrays and Hashes in Ruby](http://www.korenlc.com/nested-arrays-hashes-loops-in-ruby/) or even something a little less technical like 

Soon, we'll deploy a schedule of blog posts to you guys. Every day, three different students will have a blog post due, that they will have completed and will share with the class. You can expect to have one blog post due every two-and-a-half to three weeks (but don't hesitate to blog more frequently than that!)

In the meantime, for inspiration and to get excited about blogging, you can check out the catalogue of Flatiron Student blog posts [here](https://flatiron-blogger.herokuapp.com/posts) (you'll be prompted to log in with your GitHub account first).
